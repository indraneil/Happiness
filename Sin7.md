# 7th sin of happiness: Ignoring the source (of happiness) within (us)
To understand what it means to ignore the source within, lets begin by understanding its antidote, **mindfulness** - *it's a state in which your attention is not distracted by something other than what's happening right now.*

> What's incredible about mindfulness is that you feel happier when you're mindful, even if what you're experiencing is a negative or unpleasant event.

See related [talk from Matt Killingsworth](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment) where he asserted with data he has collected that
- People are less happy when they're mind-wandering no matter what they're doing (even commuting). 
- A big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things
- Mind wandering precedes unhappiness (and not vice versa, so we know the direction of causality)
- Mind-wandering is ubiquitous: people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. (65% when taking a shower, 50% when they're working, 40% when they're exercising to 10% when they're having sex) 

## Being mindful
It is simple to define (undivided attention of whatever is going on), but very hard to practice. 
- It is easiest to achieve when you are in flow. Also easy, when you are happy (but not delirious/ecstatic)
- Very difficult under stress or feeling negative (because of [rumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumination_(psychology))). 
  > Assume that your boss shouted at you at work. Rumination is then concluding that your job is at risk. Mindfulness is to experience what it feels to feel upset without judgement or thinking of other thoughts that alleviate or extentuate those feelings. 
- It some ways, it is the opposite of the emotion regulation strategies discussed in the chapter for the [4th sin](Sin4.md). Emotion regulation strategies do diminish the intensity of negative feelings but mindfulness diminishes it even more!
- The inner monologue of most people is a sequence of one thought leading to the next one. It is a chain of events labeled as GATE (goal/action/thought/emotion). We are caught in predictable loop of feelings leading to thoughts and actions which feed into the same set of feelings.
  - One way to break this loop is to adopt the practices of the highly happy, e.g. use flow, internal control etc.
  - Another complementary way is to step outside the GATE of your mind.

## Being a fly on the wall
You want to listen in, but stay unbiased about the outcome. You dont want to attract attention to yourself, and you dont want to change the outcome. Mindfulness is being a fly on the wall for the current internal events happening in your head. 

You will be aware of all the GATE incidents one is experiencing. You will note them but not comment on them. This act is the stepping outside the GATE of your mind. It lowers the intensity of the emotions you are feeling and slows down the GATE loop. This has important benefits.

## Benefits of mindfulness
- You will feel less stress, be more calm.
- You will demonstrate **response flexibility**: the ability to notice exactly when and which emotion or goal triggered a particular thought. 
  - This will mean you will not be always forced to respond the same way to the same stimuli. You can step in and break the cause-effect relationships. It will make it look like you have higher Emotional Intelligence.
- You will have reduced [attentional blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_blink) which will allow you to notice things better. Things will look and sound clearer (ordinary occurrences will appear extra ordinary. It obviates the saying: 
  > We dont see things as they are, we see them as we are. 
  
  Lurching around in the GATE loop involves a lot of time travel (thoughts about the past commingle with your hopes for the future). Mindfulnes keeps you firmly in the moment.
- **Mindfulness seems to be one of the very few things that can alter the [happiness set point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#Happiness_set_point)** which is the idea that you have a baseline of happiness that does not deviate for too long, regardless of change in situation.
- While everything above has mostly focused on mental/psychological benefits of mindfulness there are also demonstrated physical benefits, like thickening of the brain cells, lower inflammation, better heart health ([vagal tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagal_tone#Vagal_innervation_of_the_heart)), preventing [shortening of telomeres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere#Shortening) which slows down aging.
- Mindfulness enhances altruism, which is the 3rd habit of the highly happy.
- It also increases chances of success - high EQ, low stress, better observation all add up to more creative solutions.

## Obstacles to practicing mindfulness
### Mindfulness is voodoo 
Mindfulness is an attempt at being present in the moment. If you think this is unneeded then you underestimate how deceptive your mental filters/blindspots are.
- Religious: *This is a hindu/buddhist religious practice*: Regardless of your religious inclinations, if mindfulness is considered a powerful tool for wellbeing, it is worthwhile to adopt it (rhetorical argument: does your religion have a custom of singing in harmony? Benedictine monks, sufis, hindus all discovered this independently. Do you care who got there first?)
- Practicing **mindfulness will make you soft** ("make love not war" types): It could indeed make you more compassionate, however, it does not mean soft/weak - unless you equate compassion with weakness (this view is pervasive, people think biodegradable stuff is not strong). The US army is trying to use mindfulness training to keep marines well focused (and save lives by avoiding collateral damage or death by friendly fire).
  - Another related observation is that often people who explore mindfulness are doing because they are struggling, so observers may confuse cause and effect and think that mindfulness made them weak.

### Cognitive obstacles
  - Mindfulness equates with **not having thoughts, so very tough or weird**: It is not about not having any thoughts - it is to change your relationship with them - stop judging them right as they occur. Relatedly, mindfulness is not about thinking more clearly about your experience - it is experiencing more clearly the thoughts as they arise.
  - Smart people want to understand/experience something before they commit to it. However, mindfulness makes sense only when you practice it, not when you read about it. So we have a catch22 situation.
  - People also fear that it can take a long time (months to years) to experience the benefits: That is how most people have experienced it (e.g. 2 week Vipassana retreats). However, the scientific community now has evidence that 12-15 mins of practice per day is enough.

### Logistical challenges around practicing it
  - Need long periods of solitude, which is hard to obtain: The recommendation is to start really small (practice just for 2 mins at the start)
  - Frustration with lack of results/tendency to set high expectations
    - Start by understanding that no mindfulness session is like any other (so just see how things look for the next few mins)
    - Then tell yourself that the focus is to get out of the GATE mindset, but once the practice starts, don't worry about lack of progress (accept the outcome)
    - Micro-adjust your attention (like we do to keep our balance while riding a bike) if you start to get distracted/disappointed/pleased with your progress and keep working on it. Use compassion and dispassionate pursuit of passion to course correct.
