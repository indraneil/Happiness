# Improving your happiness

In 2019, I attended this online course on happiness hosted on Coursera called "[A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness/)" offered by Dr. Rajagopal Raghunathan who also goes by the alias of "[Dr. Happy Smarts](https://www.happysmarts.com/about-raj/)".

I took notes so that I could refer to later. 
* My initial measure of happiness was **25** (see [measuring happiness](http://labs.psychology.illinois.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Emmons-Larsen-Griffin_1985.pdf))
* There seems to be a lack of correlation between academic success and career success and further between career success and happiness
* Self reports of happiness are reliable â€“ though cross check with near and dear ones
* Enhancing happiness takes diligence
  * Consider maintaining a happiness log
  * Be open to new ideas to change old habits
* The course is laid out as 7 mistakes that people make which makes them unhappy (called sins) and how to overcome them.
