# Third sin of happiness: Being needy or aloof.
Both varieties spring from the same need for belongingness. We want to be loved so much, that we do a lot of things like mimicing others to demonstrate that we are similar, and that we want to belong to specific groups.
- [Harlow's studies on dependency in monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrNBEhzjg8I) proved that the need to be held is deep seated in primates (*warning*: the video can be upsetting to watch). 
- Many psychologists think that having strong relationships is one of the most important determinants of happiness. Happiness shared is doubled, sadness shared is halved
  > Watching an ad (good or bad) with another viewer who agrees/disagrees with you. People enjoy the experience of watching a bad ad with another viewer who agrees it was bad, than watching a good ad with some one who disagrees with you on how good it was. Agreement with others makes us feel that we have a better chance of connecting with them, which trumps everything else
- Similarly, being rejected by others makes us sad. Brain circuits light up in ways that demonstrate that social rejection hurts just as much as physical pain. Loneliness causes psychological problems like depression, but also physiological problems like diabetes.
- Counterintuitively, seeking out the feeling of being loved feverishly (being needy) can actually make us less happy. On the other end of the spectrum, denying the need to be loved (being aloof) is also bad for happiness.

## Being needy
In popular culture, there is a trope: People are incomplete without their life partner (see [famous scene from Jerry Maguire](https://media.giphy.com/media/9HsuhCHWWKc8M/giphy.gif)).
However, it is possible to take this concept too far, such that you begin to appear needy, which is a pathological outcome from an innate desire for social interaction.

### Why being needy makes you unhappy
It isn't an attractive trait for the following reasons
- **Scarcity**: We value things that are deemed to be scarce (limited time sales, think Tom Sawyer's paint the fence setup)
- **Loss of respect**: When you are needy, you're basically willing to do anything and everything for somebody else. And so, that someone else starts taking you for granted
- **Attracted towards a specific character trait**: People who are needy attract those who are emotionally cold and distant. Research suggest that the needy and the avoidants complement and attract each other. Avoidants like to believe that they're strong and independent. So they like dating people who are needy because it conforms the opinion of themselves as strong independent types. The needy on the other hand find those on the other hand as strong and independent attractive and hence want to date them. 
- **Your personal story**: I'm incomplete, fragmented, and desperately in need of a companion to complete. An important subtext of this story is that I feel insecure about what I have to offer, and about my overall attractiveness to others. I fear that I'm undeserving and unworthy of others love and attention. Such a story is not conducive for being happy. 

## Being avoidant
Feeling like you don't need the love of others to be happy is alluring. 
- **Autonomy and freedom**: The idea that we can be totally happy just by ourselves without depending on others is a seductive idea. However, whether we know it or not, we are all hugely dependent on other people.
- It sounds like the kind of thing that a mentally **strong person would do** (e.g. Rambo). However the appearance of being strong and independent is a facade. And the desire to put up this facade is a big reason why many people don't seek help when they are depressed or have psychological problems.

### Why does being avoidant make you unhappy
- One study showed that every single one of the top 10% of the **happiest people in the study had at least one really meaningful and intimate relationship**. This means, that by going it alone you'll be denying yourself the opportunity to belong to the happiest group. 
- Avoidants, in general, **get less cooperation from other people**. They don't share their feelings with others making them difficult to relate to. 
- Imagine that you are in a situation in which you need help. Avoidant people are so uncomfortable in that situation, they end up **less satisfied with the help that they get** from others - even if it's the same level of help that other people are getting. 
- **Avoidant ones feel alienated** - even though they're the ones creating the distance, but they're suffering from it. However, they don't draw the logical conclusion that if they let down their guard and were more open, they wouldn't feel as alienated. 
> All this adds up to make avoidant people less happy at work than everyone else (including the needy ones)

## The antidote: [Secure attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_attachment)
It is an approach in between being needy and being aloof. There is something called an [attachment style questionnaire](https://thinkcbt.com/experiences-relationships-scale?catid=80) to evaluate how we each fare.

### Overcoming neediness: 
Reminiscing about moments where others supported you makes you feel less needy. Also - self compassion - giving yourself the love you have been looking for might fill in the need.
- **Expressing gratitude** helps overcome neediness because it makes you feel more connected. 
- Practicing the need to love and give to others will also make us less needy and happier. 
  - It is so hardwired that even anonymous giving makes people happier. Impact of **donating to charity** on happiness, was the same as doubling of income. 
  - Generosity also makes you happier because of the story you tell yourself - I am so capable and competent that I can go help others. It also makes you feel more secure in your relationships.
  - Also reciprocity - people like you back. 

## Otherish giver vs Selfless giver: Protecting self interest when giving
There are a few common reciprocity styles
- Giver: Always thinking of what they have to offer in a conversation/relationships
- Taker: What do you have to offer to me?
- Matcher: Interact with people in a fair equitable way. 

> Researchers found that givers were the most successful at workplace - very likely because of reciprocity from their teammates. However, the bottom rung of workplace is also filled with a lot of givers - who burnt out their own opportunities. 

Analysing their differences shows that the primary difference betwen the 2 groups of givers is if they also attend to their own needs while helping others - The successful givers do, the unsuccessful givers don't. The successful givers are defined as "otherish givers" in that they are focused on helping others but they have coping strategies to limit its cost.

### Otherish givers use 2 main strategies
- Contain the cost of giving by asking
  - Are they right person for that kind of help, or can they delegate to someone else?
  - Can they find ways to help multiple people at the same time
- Excercise value extending strategies like
  - Allow themselves to feel gratitude and pride in good work, which is energizing
  - Say 'no' at times
- See the impact of your generosity: makes you feel competent
- Make being generous a fun activity, is complementary to value enhancing strategies

Effectively, otherish givers include themselves in the list of people who can benefit from the acts of charity
