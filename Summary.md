# Summary
Once our basic needs are met, we need the following things to stay happy
- **Mastery**: We covered this with discussions on flow [(in Sin2)](Sin2.md), need for superiority and internal control [(in Sin4)](Sin4.md)
- **Belongingness**: We covered this when we discussed need for right kind of connections, being generous, not being avoidant [(in Sin3)](Sin3.md) etc.
- **Autonomy**: We covered this when we talked of need for internal control, psychological reactance [(in Sin4)](Sin4.md), autonomy over our own thougts and feelings etc.
This is aligned with the ideas from [self determination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory).

## Scarcity vs. Abundance
However, if we step back a little bit more, we see that each of those requirements has 2 broad approaches which can be labeled as the **scarcity approach and the abundance approach**. Both what we are pursuing and how we are pursuing matters.
- Mastery: There are 2 routes, persuing *superiority vs. flow*.
- Belongingness: Here too are 2 approaches, the *need to be loved, or the need to love* and give
- Autonomy: The 2 routes are the need for *external control of people and outcomes vs the need for internal control*.

> **The term "scarcity" is being used to label the first route in each direction, because a person using this approach thinks in terms of zero-sum games.** They think that there can only be 1 winner and therefore you must do things that allow you to win at the expense of others, because avenues to be happy are scarce.

> **"Abundance" is used to describe the alternative approaches, because they need you to believe that there can be multiple winners.** You persue flow when you feel taken care of and so can focus on the intrinsic rewards of mastery, rather than focus on money or fame that mastery can bring. Similarly, you are more charitable and calmer when you believe you have enough.

### Mindfulness supports all the 3 goals with the abundance mindset
- Mastery: Mindfulness increases creativity and generation of insights.
- Belongingness: Mindfulness makes us more compassionate by activating our vagal tone and insular cortex.
- Autonomy: Mindfulness enhances internal control and response flexibility

## Happiness sustaining strategies
You run the risk of regressing to your old baseline for happiness unless you actively work against that. That is because old habits die hard and the scarcity mindset is often deeply conditioned into us. Similarly new channels bombard us with bad news that instill distrust in your fellow humans.
### Strategy 1: Don't postpone working on happiness 
Aka the mindset of once I am done with this immediate craziness, I will sort things out. 

Counter this by responding to a daily questions posed by a peer coach. Each question should start with the phrase: "Today, did you do your best to..", e.g. 
- "Today, did you do your best to prioritise your goal to be happy over your need to be right?"
- "Today, did you do your best to be kind and compassionate?" 
- "Today, did you do your best to exercise?"

### Strategy 2: Frame your goals in a positive way, instead of framing it as trying to block a negative outcomes. 
Ego depletion is a real problem with blocking negative outcomes (e.g. stop smoking). In stead saying I will do something that will supplant the earlier negative behavior (e.g chew gum at precisely the points when I would have smoked)

### Strategy 3: Alter your environment to remove the triggers that caused the negative behaviors. 
> Triggers are usually one of time of the day/place/something you are doing/someone you are meeting. Find your problematic cues and remove them. You can't over-eat icecream if you dont stock it in your fridge.

### Strategy 4: Find a like minded peer group
Find groups - someone you can learn from (goal achieving mindsets are contagious), and someone you can teach. 

There are often plateaus you reach, and relearning or teaching can both get you out of them. 

Just be mindful that most people don't like to get advice from other people on happiness (most people have personal happiness theories that they don't want challenged).

### Strategy 5: Be open to new experiences that might enhance happiness. 
Don't assume that because you are an introvert you can't engage in the gratitude exercise. 
> All identities are ultimately somewhat constraining. The more you give yourself the freedom to change (e.g. growth mindset), the easier it may be for you to adopt new happiness habits. 

Any change is uncomfortable, but if your current situation sucks, then you must weather out the initial uncomfortabe hump to get out of the sucky situation.

__My new happiness score is 28: It means I am happy and I know that that I am happy.__ This is an improvement from my initial score of 25. (see [measuring happiness](http://labs.psychology.illinois.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Emmons-Larsen-Griffin_1985.pdf))
