# 5th Sin of happiness - Distrusting others
*It involves believing that others are distrustful until they are proven trustworthy.* The antidote is exercising *smart trust*, which means trusting others in a way that maximizes the chances of benefiting from trusting others, while minimizing the chance that you get cheated upon. 

## Advantages to trusting others
- **High trust countries are happier**, likely because the cost of a transaction does not have to include extra precautions like lawyers.
- Ability to trust your neighbors have been tied to **longevity** in our evolutionary past.
- When you trust others (or are trusted), the oxycotin hormone is released (also released when people are in love or when a mother if feeding her baby). **People who are trusted rarely break trust, even with strangers.**

### However trusting and getting it wrong has very big downsides
- Evolutionarily, if you want to see something that looks like food, but you suspect that it is a predatory trap, then the upside of food pales in comparison to the downside of being dead, since you can always find food later.

### Proactive trust and its benefits
In repeat transactions though, it is beneficial to show proactive trust, because it can lead to a virtuous cycle of mutual trust.
- We get to embed ourselves in a **web of trustworthy relationships**, which is helpful for repeat transactions
- We get to **play a role in building a culture of mutual trust**, which makes us feel like our societal contributions matter.
- We get a **psychological boost from having our trust reciprocated**, because most people do reciprocate.
  > Anecdote of how the Toronto Star newspaper dropped 20 wallets with $200 each and noted how 16 of those were returned. While Canada is a high trust country, and it isn't surprising that so many wallets were returned, **it is instructive to know that when Canadians were asked to estimate how many would be returned, they had guessed at a much lower 23%**. This suggests that even if this experiment is done in Mumbai or Athens, and the real number of returned wallets is lower, it is likely that residents of Numbai will guess a far lower number than what will eventually get returned.
- People on average seem to be far more cynical and distrusting of others than they ought to be from the standpoint of maximizing happiness. 
  - So if the stakes are low enough, it may be better to show proactive trust.

## Strategies for smart trust
Remember that people are more trustworthy than we tend to think and that there are hidden benefits to proactive trust
- Minimizing the psychological damage from being cheated upon: Understand that what you are doing is risky, and so you need some safeguards
  - Start by recognizing that - very likely - *you are better off than most folks and can afford more instances of being cheated upon.*. So let the small stuff slide. <br/>In other words, the better off should do more to increase trust levels in society rather than leaving it upon poorer folks to keep up the good work. 
  - While it isn't ok to try and extact revenge on cheaters, or hold them responsible for your happiness, *it is ok to confront them about the violation of interpersonal trust*. It might also give you a different view of what happened (what was considered a violation of trust may just have been a miscommunication)
  - Finally, if you do get cheated, it will hurt and it makes most sense to anticipate that and *work on forgiving people to ease your own pain*. Approach to forgiveness
    - Empathize with the circumstances that force a person to cheat. People have an innate desire to help, so overcoming that must involve serious unhappiness in the cheater.
    - Remind yourself not to feel morally superior. We may do the same if we are in their shoes. In stead feel grateful that we are more privileged.
