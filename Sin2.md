# 2nd sin of happiness: Chasing a sense of superiority over others

## Reasons for doing so: 
* Approval of others
* which further conditions you to tie it to your self esteem
* It helps you achieve a sense of mastery, which is an import life goal
* Makes you think you have more autonomy (e.g. bosses think so), which is also an important life goal

## Why chasing superiority lowers happiness
* Comparisons are essential to discovering superiority, which means sometimes you will be behind.
  * **You can't be envious and happy at the same time**
  * Envy is worse when you feel some degree of kinship with the person you are envious of.
* **Encourages materialism** - often harder to compare on direct skills/talent, but easier on observable things like accessories.
  * Makes you unhappy, because it makes you lonelier (you build fences), also the high from new things is short lived
  * Disliked by others - you spend so much time comparing yourself to others, that they stop liking you

## How to be successful while giving up the desire for superiority: look for flow
* Chasing superiority lowers outcomes in intellectual persuits (though might be useful in physical ones)
* A big reward may increase motivation to compete and practice, but focusing on the reward hampers performance during the test.
* Look for meaning/purpose, working on something purposeful will help you experience "[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))"

### Characteristics of flow
  - **Distorted perception of time**: Things will slow down during flow and time will fly in retrospect.
  - **Lack of self consciousness**: so absorbed in the activity, your inner voice will quieten
  - **Intense focus on the present moment**.

### Conditions for flow
- Ability required for the task at hand is just a little higher than available ability. 
  - In paired contests, flow happens when your opponent's skill are close to yours, but just a little higher than yours.
  - You need to feel stretched, by just the right amount. Too much and you are discouraged. Too little, you will be bored.
- Flow lasts longer for higher skilled people. Even pairings of low skill people has too many interruptions for flow to last very long, e.g. a rally between Nadal and Federer will last longer, letting them experience flow for longer.

### Why does flow enhance happiness?
- **Enjoyable in the moment**: Flow allows discovery of new meaningful ways to grow.
- **Flow makes you charismatic** - when talent is on display. People like other people who display flow, because displays of flow can draw in the audience (e.g. Nadal-Federer matchup!), your flow does not come at my expense. This isn't true for other external displays, e.g. of money or power, which make others feel threatened.
- You need about **10,000 hours of flow like experience to achieve significant success**. People rarely exceed 20 hours of flow per week, which means they take about 10 years to get to elite levels.
  - The resulting mastery is a key to happiness.

### Getting flow back in your life
Most people spend so much time of their life at work and rarely achieve flow there. This leads to people fanatasizing about quitting and starting over. A lot of folks postpone achieving flow till they retire, but by then have often lost their ability to focus hard enough to achieve flow.
- A quick way to fix that is to pick up any hobby and find a way to challenge yourself in that hobby. 
- Prof. Steven Tomlison thinks that to get flow at work, you need 2 ingredients -  *"What you are good at, and what the world needs:*.
  - Ability to use your innate talent in some constructive way: Ponder about your skills and try and practice those skills at work. Take more responsibility if your current job doesn't need your skills. 
  > Dont quit your job, instead bend it till it breaks. Show people what you can do, so that you get invited to do more things.
  - Ability to help others, rather than impressing folks or getting desirable objects. Focus on what is going on around you that warrants your attention. Working on those will channel something deeper than your ego.
- Dr HappySmarts tweaks it to say: Flow is at the intersection of a venn diagram involving these questions *"What are you good at? What the world needs? What do you enjoy most?"*
  If however, you don't know what you are good at, or what you enjoy most, then follow this recipe:
  - Take some time off to experiment (while keeping your current boring job)
  - Meet people who do what you like
  - Do things that excite you
- Also recommends 3 books on how to change out of a boring job:
  - Working identity: Herminia Ibarra
  - The element: Ken Robinson
  - Drive: Daniel H. Pink

## Mitigating the need for superiority
You can become good at something by experiencing flow and then get focused on being superior and eventually stop being happy. To avoid this pitfall, use a two-pronged practice for mitigating the need for superiority. 
- First practice is for when things are going badly, e.g., you've just had a string of failures. 
- The second practice is for when life is going well. For example, you've just had a string of successes. 
- The practices are: self compassion for when things are going badly, and gratitude when things are going well. 

### Self compassion: 
It has 3 components, however, don't confuse it with self pity.
- **Kindness to self:** Practice being kind to yourself when you fail, much like you would if you watched a friend fail. 
- **Feel connected with common humanity:** Happens only to me is an isolating feeling. Recognize that suffering and imperfection are part of the shared human condition. This is one other way the need for superiority is suppressed.
- **Mindfulness**: refers to being present with what is, without resistance and kind of accepting what is, even if it's uncomfortable.

#### How to be self compassionate
- **Role play:** speak of your situation in 3rd person and be compassionate to that person.
- **Write a letter to yourself as a compassionate friend.**

### Gratitude
At the point of success, when you are swimming in hubristic pride, think about all the folks who helped you succeed - your spouse, your team etc. This feeling of gratefulness will trigger a feeling of connection with these people. You can then express it, and it will bring you closer to these folks. Gratitude acts as a bridge between hubris (short term happiness as per lesson 1) and connection (longer term happiness). It acts as a meta-strategy towards happiness - by making you grateful for things you have instead of what you don't, and also being slow to taking your current status for granted
