# 4th sin of happiness: Being overly control seeking
It comes in 2 main varieties
- Trying to change behavior in others, e.g. spouse/kids/pets
- Change your outcomes, like TV channels or room temperature, or choose the work we do

This desire for control arises because people do better when they are in control.
- People with control over trivial decisions report greater levels of happiness, and it even impacts their longevity
- Those with greater desire for control tend to aim higher and achieve more.

However, there seems to be a limit to how much control should be sought, after which, we see diminishing returns.

## How trying to control people lowers happiness: 
People want to control others, but want to stay independent themselves. 
- Trying to control other people will often trigger [**pyschological reactance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)); e.g. if you ask your spouse to eat healthier, it might increase their consumption of unhealthy food just to spite you. There is tension between how much you can control someone and how much they can love you back. Since being loved is fundamental to happiness, being overly controlling can decrease your happiness.
- Another reason for unhappiness is **power stress**: tendency to get angry when others don't behave in desired ways. 
  > 2 sets of speakers (sorted by high and low need for power) were given 2 scripted sets of feedback (positive and negative), and their emotions were measured. Unsurprisingly, both sets liked the positive feedback, but people with high need for power hated the negative feedback more. 
  
  Frustration when others don't follow your instructions will lower your happiness.
- Quality of outcomes suffers if you want to control people. This prevents a diversity of opinions from surfacing, because you get surrounded by yes-men. Bad outcomes lower your happiness.

## How trying to control outcomes lowers happiness: 
Desiring an outcome isn't bad, overly controling is defined as when your desire controls you and not the other way round. The difference is hard to gauge. 
- However, what is very evident that people who need a lot of control seem to **often become disappointed**, angry or depressed because things rarely go per plan.
- Also, people who need a lot of control are likely to **take more risks** (e.g. drive more rashly if they are late) or become more superstitious to keep things in control as compensatory actions. All of this makes for poor decisions in the long run.
- Wanting a specific outcome desperately will often trigger obsessions which have negative impact on other relationships. However, this often **triggers burnout**, which decreases likelyhood of success, making you further unhappy.

## Knowing how much of a control freak you are:
- [Desirability of control scale](https://isb.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8CzIEgUbSdUEPVr?user_id=%25USER_ID%25&Q_JFE=qdg) - I apparently have a normal level of control seeking tendency (90, where the median is between 90-100)
- [Maximizer-saticficer scale](https://isb.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ahs9pNCpzadKNhj?user_id=%25USER_ID%25&Q_JFE=qdg) - I apparently have a maximizer tendency (score of 44, so I am constantly looking to improve a situation and be a bit more control seeking than normal). Note that **Maximizers are less happy than satisficers**.
> My score analysis: You have the potential to be overly controlling (that is mixed) in certain situations - it's also very likely that you have personally experienced how it deflates your happiness levels.

## Antidote: Taking personal responsibility for your own happiness
> No matter the weather outside, it is always sunny in my head
- Research has shown that specific thought patterns seem to precede specific feelings, e.g. if success is attributed to your work, it preceeds prideful feelings, vs. if success is attributed to help from others, it preceeds gratitude. That means, we can think our way to specific feelings.
- In stead of asserting that your happiness is predicated on cooperation of external people or outcomes, attempt to retain the keys to your happiness with yourself. Most folks have 2 main reasons to be reluctant to try this idea
  - **Pessimism**: They imagine that they can't be indifferent to bad outcomes like a personal injury in an accident so it isn't worth trying it elsewhere. 
  > Dr Happysmarts thinks that that is the wrong question: The right question to ask is whether you can be happy given the sort of commonplace and everyday events that routinely spoil your mood (e.g. traffic jams). Once you have mastered those situation, you can aim for Mandela or Gandhi like equanimity.
  - **Fear of being taken advantage of**: The fear is that if I am never unhappy, people will assume they have a free pass to misbehave with me. Counterpoint - Taking personal responsibility for your happiness doesn't mean that you don't hold others accountable for their actions. 
  > If a ticketing agent booked you on a wrong flight, you dont have to get angry with them, but you can be calm and ask them to fix the problem so that you can get to your destination.
- Higher scores of self control are associated with higher GPA, higher self esteem, less binge eating, better inter-personal skills etc.

## How is better self control/taking personal responsibility countering the sin of obsessive control?
- Taking personal responsibility of your own happiness means exercising internal control which lowers your desire for external control, which in turn makes you less externally controlling. Also it fulfils our desire for mastery.
  - Folks with low self control try to exert external control, and vice versa. Religious people often seem to have high self control because they think God can help and is listening to them.
- You will still want to influence outcomes and people, but will be less desperate/more mature going about it.
  - So people will like you better, and co-operate with you and their contributions will lead to better outcomes

## Emotion regulation strategies for better self control: 
2 main strategies - Learning simple tactics to control emotions and leading a healthier lifestyle

### Tactics to control emotions 
- **Situation selection**: Thinks of ways to stay out of trouble (preconsidered avoidance tactic)
- **Labeling your emotions**: Describing the emotion you are feeling to yourself will lower your intensity. Labeling is different from analyzing your emotions (which can make you defend your actions and increase your emotions). Putting a name to the emotion seems to make you think of way to placate it, e.g. if you can realize that you are frightened, you can then consider how you will want to cope with this feeling.
- **Attention deployment**: Direct attention away from negative thoughts and towards positive thoughts. However, the most common way of doing this (praising yourself for success and blaming externalities for failures) is a suboptimal approach (it is self delusional). A better way to do it is to focus on things that trigger authentic pride or feelings of love.
- **Cognitive reappraisal**: Reinterpret situations to feel better about them. If you are worried about a stressful meeting pump yourself up by saying that it is a privilege to be able to present your view in such a high visbility podium.
- However, dont suppress your emotions - it does not work: Your limbic system continues to stress about it, even when you arent articulating the feeling. It also distracts you from the task at hand. Also others can see it and it stresses them out too.

### Appreciating uncertainity and leading a healthier lifestyle
- Perfect foreknowledge and control leads to a boring life. 
  > People don't want to know the outcome of a match they haven't watched, or learn spoilers about a movie.
- People have an ideal stimulation level - below that life is too predictable and boring. Above that, life is anxiety inducing. Things just at that level is often a recipe for flow.
- However, most people lead far too uncertain and busy lives, so they don't appreciate the positive aspects of uncertainity. So slowing down a bit and doing fewer things may actually make it easier to deal with this. So the recommendation is to decrease your stress levels by
  - **Eat right**: bad eating habits makes you gain weight and feel low energy, which adds to your stress (feeling of loss of control)
  - **Moving more**: Sitting for 6+ hours is as bad as smoking for mortality. Exercising doesn't necessarily counter that effect. 2 min breaks after 20+ minutes of sitting counters things better. Also 90% people who keep off weight exercise at home in the morning.
  - **Sleeping better**: Only 2.5% people need less than 7 hours of sleep. Sleep makes for better decision making, increases emotional stability, and decreases craving for bad food. Lack of sleep suppresses your immune system.

> Practicing emotional control and leading a healthier lifesytle is a long journey with occassional failures. It is important therefore to practice self compassion, because there will be days when you will fail, and you need to know how to forgive yourself and start over.

> It's never your job to make your partner happy. That is their own responsibility. It's your job to love them, and to make *yourself* happy. But make sure no one ever holds *you* responsible for *their* happiness. [Source](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/fj1cja/my_dad_passed_away_when_i_f_was_13_im_22_now_what/fkktesw/)
