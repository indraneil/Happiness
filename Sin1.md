# 1st sin of happiness: People devalue happiness

## Examples include
* **To get a good deal** (when paying for food by weight in a salad bar, if chickpea costs less than chicken, and you prefer chickpea, most people still take some chicken to get value for money)
* **To be right** (partner ignores good advice until someone else says the same, so even though you are better off if the partner follows the advice, you still waste time arguing over how you suggested it first)
* **To make money** (job choices for MBA students change from charitable to money minded as they get closer to having to interview)

## Why do we devalue happiness? 
(See [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIqtIuMQ8zwUmQ3SXBBdzRJeXc/view) and [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIqtIuMQ8zwUmQ3SXBBdzRJeXc/view))
1.	We have misconceptions about happiness. 
    1. **Happiness makes us lazy**. Good ideas come up more often when people are relaxed, leading to better outcomes.
    2. **Happiness makes us selfish**. Actual evidence suggest happy people are more sociable and helpful.
    3. **Happiness is fleeting**. Depends on how you define it. Sensory pleasure based happiness is fleeting. Happiness based on contentment of your current state is not.
2.	People don’t define happiness concretely for themselves, therefore falling to [fluency effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluency_heuristic). Other pressing ideas will hog your attention, because they are better defined.
3.	We are susceptible to medium maximization: Since you don’t define happiness, you spent time defining the pathways to becoming happy and then get caught up in that process – e.g. money/status can enable happiness, but we spend too much time maximizing them for their own sake. It creates a tendency to chase the means to happiness and forgetting the end goal.

## Coping strategies to mitigate devaluing happiness
Prioritizing but not pursuing happiness (similar to sleep). See [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIqtIuMQ8zwN24xbUIzenh1OFE/view) 
1. Remind yourself to make happiness inducing decisions before making a decision. Even a periodic email reminder is often enough.
2. However, don’t aggressively monitor or chase happiness – stressing out about stressing out creates worse outcomes.

## Happiness definitions
### Short term ones (not recommended)
* **Sensory pleasure**: good food, party etc. // fleeting
* **Hubristic pride**: I am better than who I compare myself to // does not last either, pride comes before a fall

### Have more potential to last longer
* **Authentic pride**: I am better today than I was before
* **Love/connection**: With a person/place/thing
* **Abundance/Joy**: feeling of we have everything we need, life is perfect with its imperfections. Life is interesting (and not threatening) because of the challenges. // has the most potential to last the longest

## Here are a few more possible interpretations
* Serenity
* Interest/curiosity
* Amusement/laughter: Laughing will make you happier

## My personal definition of happiness
I seem to be personally attracted to a mix of these. 
I hope that I end my life with a sense of abundance and serenity. However, for now 
* I am often attracted to feelings of love/connection with my family, especially when we share an amusing anecdote.
* I also chase authentic pride which often follows curiosity , especially at work.
* List of things that make me happy
  * Family, esp. time spent with wife and kids
  * A personal milestone/revelation after struggling with something (exercise/work etc.)
  * A good book or an interesting conversation
  * A creative exercise like completing a blog post
