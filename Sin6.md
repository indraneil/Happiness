# 6th sin of happiness: Distrusting life
- If trusting others can be important for happiness (see [5th sin](Sin5.md)), then it follows that trusting that good things are going to happen to you in your life is also going to be very important for your happiness. 
  - **Resilience**: trusting that setbacks have some valuable lessons for you that allow you to evolve into a better person. It is an important skill to cultivate for your happiness
- Now most of us recognize a truth about life, that **you can't tell if an immediate outcome being good or bad, will lead to good or bad long term consequences**. However, we seldom take this fact about life to its logical conclusion which is this
  > "We shouldn't rely on outcomes for our happiness".
- Prof. Sonja Lyubomirsky in the "Myths of Happiness"
  > When we consider the single best thing that has happened to us in the past years - and the single worst thing - we may be surprised to learn that they are often one and the same thing". 
  
  Her research shows that **external outcomes account for only 10% of a person's happiness** (genetic propensity accounts for 50%, while attitudes/beliefs/world views account for the other 40%)

## Common concerns from people about practicing changes to ensure outcomes don't impact happiness
 - *Delinking happiness from outcomes will never allow you to feel happy again*
    - Counter: Research shows that people are happier being busy than being idle (as long as there exists even a flimsy reason to be busy).
    - This makes it look like **delinking happiness from outcomes is possible as long as people use the process (and not outcome) as a source of happiness**
    - Flimsy reasons may be enough to keep people busy, but meaningful reasons keep people engaged for longer.
 - *You may never again feel motivated to persue a goal*
    - Counter: Delinking happiness from outcomes refers to not judging outcomes **after** the outcome has happened and not **before** the outcome is decided (the desired outcome should be persued with as much energy as is needed at that point). 
    - After the outcome is reached though, dont get hung up. Positive or negative outcomes can both lead to unexpected downstream consequences.

## How to delink happiness from outcomes
(Scenario: Assume that a highly desirable person proposed marriage to you. You think getting married to them sets you up for happiness for life)
   - At every point consider the possible outcomes and put in mitigations for the undesirable outcomes.
     - (Actively work to understand what is highly valued by your partner, and see how to align that with your own motivations. This allows you to enjoy their company while keeping your own sanity)
   - Focus on enjoying the processes you put in place. 
     - (Engage in activities both of you find meaningful rather than take them for granted)

## Another way to think about this
There are 3 possible ways to approach goals
- **Obsessive pursuit of passion**: Strong preference for certain outcomes both before and after outcomes have occurred. 
  - Such an approach leads to long running regrets.
- **Indifferent pursuit of passion**: Don't care both before and after the outcome. 
  - Some times, people will accept any outcome, but it should happen after the outcome has arrived and not before. 
  - "Open to anything" might sound cool, but is actually a sign of helplessness and depression. It leads to becoming unmotivated, which is unlikely to make you happy. 
- **Dispassionate pursuit of passion**: Show preference for certain outcomes before they have occurred, but being non-judgemental after they have occurred. 
  - *It is tough because it breaks the desire for a consistent view of things.* This approach however enhances happiness levels and chances of success.

### Strategies for instilling the dispassionate pursuit of passion
- **Reflect on past negative events**: They hurt when they happened but you likely don't think badly of them in hindsight. We seem to over-estimate both the intensity and duration of unhappiness of the outcomes. See related concepts of [affective misforecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting) and [fading affect bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fading_affect_bias). 
  - This reflection exercise should make you realize that *if you have changed your mind about past negative events then you will likely do the same for the current negative event* (and if so, why not do it now?)
  > **Related idea**: Keep a [decision journal](https://blog.trello.com/decision-journal) to track what you considered when you decided on important things in life, and review it periodically. See [hacker news discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22694014) on this idea for more food for thought.
- Look for ways of how the seemingly **negative outcomes have triggered positive outcomes**: One way is to practice gratitude. Doing this after a positive event will mitigate the need for superiority - [the 2nd sin](Sin2.md), but it was easier at that point, but it can be done when negative things happen as well. 
  - The trick is to focus on the moment and not the event. The terrible things provides an opportunity to rise to it. If you rise to it, people admire you. If you fail, you get another opportunity :-) So be grateful for the opportunities that arose because of the negative event. 
  - See this Ted talk on [how to be grateful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=UtBsl3j0YRQ).
- Keep a **journal to track negative events that triggered positive events**: Doing it for small everyday things increases your tolerance for negative events.

## Happiness and spirituality:
**Spiritual attitude**: Everything happens for the best. It is based on an implicit trust in life, that you will survive and thrive based on the current experience. This is in contrast with 2 other hypotheses about life:
- Life is indifferent to you. 
- Life is malign and cant be trusted

The interesting thing is that none of the 3 hypotheses can be ruled out. Each view is as much delusional or scientific as the other, mostly because of placebo effect (which can be summarized as "subjective beliefs of truth shapes objective truth"), e.g. Carol Dweck showed people with growth mindset outperform people with fixed mindsets.

There are clear instances where your subjective belief does not shape the truth (e.g. holding a flat-earth hypothesis does not impact the shape of earth), but also several places where it does. Your opinion on life seems to be one such place. 

Whatever you believe, you seem to get evidence for it. So while there is no compelling proof that life is benign, having that faith seems to enhance happiness levels (if that is your goal).

### 3 good things with a twist
- The concept of 3 good things is to keep a journal in which you list 3 mildly goods things that happened that day. It has shown to help people feel better in about 2 weeks
- This exercise is similar in which we keep a journal of 3 things that started out looking bad, but in hindsight provided some useful outcomes.
